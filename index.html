			<h3>Next Meetup: TBD</h3>

			<p><strong>When:</strong> January 27th, 2016 @ 5:30<br /><strong>Where:</strong> MadGlory/Odd Networks Office, Saratoga Springs, NY</p>

			<p><a href="/repos">Past Meetup Repos</a></p>

			<hr />

			<h3>Another Tech Meetup?</h3>
			<p>Well, yes and no. At this meetup we want to get pushed out of our comfort zone away from our favorite languages. We believe great software engineers are knowledgable enough to assess any problem and use the right tool for the job. Not the flavor of the week. Not old faithful.</p>
			<p>You may have your favorite tech, but how will you grow if you don't explore new things? With this meetup we will aim to explore all aspects of software engineering.</p>

			<h3>Quick Tutorials Meets Mini Hackathons</h3>
			<p>Sitting and listening to people ramble on for hours about tech and doing live programming doesn't benefit anyone. We think everyone should get their hands dirty and actually program, together, hackathon style, especially if you are surrounded by smart people!</p>
			<p>Our meetups consist of a few <strong>10-15 minute</strong> presentations then after that its right to hacking away. Presenters will come prepared with working code to show you and then you get to mess with it yourself, ask questions, break things, fix things, and most important, learn new things!</p>
			<p>If any of these topics pique your interests then you belong with us!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>RSS parser that authenticates and downloads videos concurrently with Elixir</li>
				<li>Small Node.js microservices and pattern matching using SenecaJS</li>
				<li>Compute the sales tax of a given total and zip code with C</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We don't always want to come up with the ideas so if you would like to present or suggest a topic <a href="https://github.com/agnostechvalley/agnostechvalley.github.io/issues">create an issue</a> and tell us about it.</p>

			<h3><a name="become-a-polyglot"></a>Becoming a Polyglot</h3>
			<p>If you would like to join the community and be notified of future meetups and discussion <a href="https://github.com/agnostechvalley/agnostechvalley.github.io/issues">create an issue</a> and request we add you to our <strong>Polyglot</strong> team!</p>
