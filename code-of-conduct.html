			<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

			<h3>About</h3>

			<p>Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The AgnosTechValley members are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.</p>

			<p>The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about technology effectively, productively, and respectfully.</p>

			<p>The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.</p>

			<p>The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the group; for it to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.</p>

			<p>We believe that healthy debate and disagreement are essential to a healthy project and community. However, it is never ok to be disrespectful. We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.</p>

			<h3>Member values</h3>

			<p>These are the values to which people in the AgnosTechValley community should aspire.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
				<li>
					Be patient
					<ul>
						<li>Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Be thoughtful
					<ul>
						<li>Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.</li>
						<li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Be respectful
					<ul>
						<li>In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Be charitable
					<ul>
						<li>Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.</li>
						<li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Avoid destructive behavior:
					<ul>
						<li>Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.</li>
						<li>Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
						<li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
						<li>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.</li>
						<li>Microaggressions: the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based soley upon their margianalized group membership.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

			<h4>Our Pledge</h4>

			<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

			<h4>Our Standards</h4>

			<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
				<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
				<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
				<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
				<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>				
			</ul>

			<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
				<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
				<li>Public or private harassment</li>
				<li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
				<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Our Responsibilities</h4>

			<p>Community organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>

			<p>Community organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

			<h4>Scope</h4>

			<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by community organizers.</p>

			<h4>Conflict Resolution</h4>

			<p>We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the community's code of conduct.</p>

			<p>If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.</p>

			<p>Reports should be directed to Erik Straub or Blain Smith, the community organizers. It is the community organizers' duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct.</p>

			<p>We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the community and community-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.</p>

			<h4>Attribution</h4>

			<p>This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html">https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html</a></p>
			
			<h3>Summary</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Treat everyone with respect and kindness.</li>
				<li>Be thoughtful in how you communicate.</li>
				<li>Don’t be destructive or inflammatory.</li>
				<li>If you encounter an issue, please get in touch with Erik or Blain.</li>
